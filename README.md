**Keylogger Project**

This project aims to create a basic keylogger in Python for Windows 11 systems. The keylogger silently captures and logs keystrokes made by users on the computer. It operates discreetly in the background, without displaying any visible signs of its presence to the user.

**Features:**
- Captures and logs keystrokes in real-time.
- Stealth operation: Runs silently in the background.
- Logs keystrokes to a text file (`keylog.txt`).
- Easy deployment and execution on Windows 11 systems.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x installed on your Windows 11 system.
- Installation of the `pynput` library. You can install it via pip:
  ```
  pip install pynput
  ```

**Usage:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and the `pynput` library are installed on your system.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
4. Run the keylogger script using the command:
   ```
   python keylogger.py
   ```
5. The keylogger will start silently capturing and logging keystrokes to the `keylog.txt` file.

**Important Notes:**
- Use this keylogger responsibly and ethically.
- Be aware of legal regulations regarding the use of monitoring software.
- Respect user privacy and confidentiality.
- This keylogger is for educational purposes only.
